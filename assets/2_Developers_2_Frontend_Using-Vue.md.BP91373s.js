The rational is, the website should work for as many people as possible. By focusing on a non-js experience by default, it forces us to leverage basic html patterns and make sure that we have well defined APIs that the front-end is POSTing or GETting to/from. In general, other than the Library Explorer experience (which is a self-contained demo) and the librarian merge UI, we don&#39;t build core pages in vue and vue is typically used as a progressive enhancement (in a way that graceful degrades when a patron doesn&#39;t have javascript, so the rest of the page works).</p><h1 id="when-to-use-vue" tabindex="-1">When to use Vue <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-to-use-vue" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;When to use Vue&quot;">​</a></h1><p>Some website features are non-essential enhancements (like the Read Stats) whose very purpose is to present a view in a rich way using javascript.
